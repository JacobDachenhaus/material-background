# Material Generator
NOTE: I've found that many textures from [Transparent Textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/) work well as an overlay.  

## Basic structure
Replace 'x' with an identifier for the material.
```html
<div class="material material-x">
  <!-- Content -->
  <div class="material-background material-background-x"></div>  
</div>
```
